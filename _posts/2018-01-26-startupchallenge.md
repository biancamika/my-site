## Youthhack Manila
Youthhack Manila is the NCR chapter of Youthhack, a nonprofit organization that helps students learn more about startups, technology and entrepreneurship.

### Startup Challenge
Startup Challenge is an annual two-day event with the goal of bringing students into the exciting world of startups and technopreneurship. Youthhack Manila partners with the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to execute this event.

# Theme
For 2018, the theme of the event was "Think Global, Act Global". In line with this, I took inspiration from colorful vintage Filipino advertisements. I wanted to convey this look in the event's identity with a modern, technological twist.

# Logo
Based on the theme, the logo is a person on a location pin. The person's head is a globe icon, with its body containing a heart. The icon without the logotype can only be used in Startup Challenge pubmats made by Youthhack Manila; external organizations must use the full logo.

intro: "Identity and collateral for a mental healthy creativity fair"
---

Lucent (previously named Luna) is an annual creativity fair that aims to promote mental health awareness through art, workshops, talks, and performances. As the Creatives Head, I was responsible for designing of the event's identity and collateral + managing a team of ~5 creatives.

### Theme
I based the design of the fair for the year 2018 on the sun, which conveyed multiple meanings: light, hope, warmth, etc.

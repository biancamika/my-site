The **365 Wonders 2019 Creative Planner** is a creative planner that aimed to spark feminist consciousness through Filipino art. It is an initiative of [Woman, Create](https://womancreate.com/): an art studio that focuses in art-making, design, independent publication and events, and advocacy for intersectional feminism (or ‘everyday’ feminism) for Filipinos. Copies of this planner were sold nationwide, and a portion of its proceeds were donated to Young Focus, a non-profit organization that works to bring education to kids and families in Smokey Mountain, Tondo, Manila.

As one of the five Creatives Interns of Woman, Create for the batch of Summer 2018, I contributed to the "Diversity" cover (first cover, bottom-left part) and created two monthly cover artworks based  on feminist themes.

### She Stands
Month: January | Theme: "Feminism: Where We Stand"

In a patriarchal narrative, gender roles are strictly defined — with man, being the breadwinners and women, only caretakers. Because we raise girls with this construct, girls struggle with the notions of leadership. This is a reminder that leadership is not gender-based, but an intrinsic, human-based characteristic.

Inspiration is derived from girls who strive to succeed in a world designed to be against them. Pastel colors play an element of feminity for girls who do not need to embody constructs of masculinity in order to exude power. A scout and a soldier was shown in the belief that both can embody girl power. The background illustrates an ideal world: one of solidarity.

### Are You Asking for This?
Month: October | Theme: "Power"

To this day, women globally continue to live daily in a constant state of fear. Violence and harassment against women knows no logic, shape, or form. Studies by feminist scholars have often examined the effects on women living in fear, which may range from extra protection measures, establishing precautional routines, conformity to standardized rules. Overall, these effects reflect the powerless of women in the face of patriarchal violence.

This piece is an alternative of that powerlessness. Comically drawn that exudes inspiration from superhero graphic novels, this illustrates a girl who is no longer a reflection of these effects. Cornered in an alley, she wants to fight back. Unsheathing her sword, she is ready for the attack

## EDITION:FEMINISM

Contributor artworks were also shown in EDITION: FEMINISM, a month-long contemporary exhibit that idealizes a feminist revolution that considers the Filipino people.

# Lucent Fair
Lucent (previously named Luna) is an annual creativity fair that aims to promote mental health awareness through art, workshops, talks, and performances. As the Creatives Head, I was responsible for designing of the event's identity and collateral.

## Theme
I based the design of the fair for the year 2018 on the sun, which conveyed multiple meanings: light, hope, warmth, etc.

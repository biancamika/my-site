[Areté](https://arete.ateneo.edu/) is the creativity and innovation hub of Ateneo de Manila University. It provides support, programming, and space for different minds, talents, and expressions to meet, solve problems together, and make knowledge and solutions accessible to the public.

## Context

In response to the pandemic, Areté launched [Areté Connect](https://arete.ateneo.edu/connect), an online portal of its programs, which were the following: **Our Way Forward** (a series of analyses, speculations, and projections on the ways that the COVID crisis will shape our future, and the resilient systems we should build in its aftermath), **Virtual Programs** (open-level classes on craft, dance, exercise, etc.), and **Theatre in Demand** (full-length plays made available online). I was tasked to illustrate banners of these.

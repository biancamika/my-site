# Pinpointe
Pinpointe is a hypothetical app that assists ballet-based dancers in correcting their weaknesses in technique. Users first go through a test composed of simple, personalized questions. Once the app has centered on a problem, it recommends solutions (e.g. tutorials, workouts) from online sources. 

### Why?
This idea was born from my frustrations as a dance student. Jealous of the hyperflexible dancers on Instagram, I would stretch frequently. However, Iâ€™d overexert my hip flexors in the process. I had to be taught that strengthening was also crucial for improvement. Lack of knowledge = lack of body awareness.

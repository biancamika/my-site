All-kill: (n.) when a song reaches #1 in all realtime charts.

Allkill Apparel was a mockup clothing brand that created minimalistic clothes inspired by Korean culture and aesthetic. Tired of the typical jersey shirts that defined K-pop fan merchandise, I created this brand as a design experiment. I designed the brand's identity and collateral, along with its first collection. I also shot and edited the photos released.

# 21st Century
The brand's first collection, “21st Century”, was inspired by BTS’ album “Wings”.

# Collateral

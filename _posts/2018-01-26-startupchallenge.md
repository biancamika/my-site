## Youthhack Manila
[Youthhack Manila](https://www.facebook.com/YouthHackMNL/) is the NCR chapter of [Youthhack](https://youthhack.net/), a nonprofit organization that helps students learn more about startups, technology and entrepreneurship.

## Startup Challenge
[Startup Challenge](https://www.facebook.com/events/dict-youthhack-mnl-startup-challenge-2018-high-school-edition/358278664584510/) is an annual two-day event with the goal of bringing students into the exciting world of startups and technopreneurship. Youthhack Manila partners with the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to execute this event.

As the Marketing Core - Design member assigned to this event, I directed its visual identity and made collateral.

### Theme

For 2018, the theme of the event was "Think Global, Act Global". In line with this, I took inspiration from colorful vintage Filipino advertisements. I wanted to convey this look in the event's identity with a modern, technological twist.

### Color

The main colors used were teal and yellow, along with their shades. These colors were also paired with neutrals (e.g. white, beige, brown) in making collaterals.

### Logo

Based on the theme, the logo is a person on a location pin. The person's head is a globe icon, with its body containing a heart. The icon without the logotype can only be used in Startup Challenge pubmats made by Youthhack Manila; external organizations must use the full logo.

Aside from the typical collateral for marketing an event, Startup Challenge also shared educational pubmats on startups and technopreneurship.

After the event, all of the participants' proposals were collated and visualized in a PDF titled "Idea Book". This was then presented to representatives from DICT.

intro: "Identity and collateral for a mental health creativity fair"
---

[Lucent](https://www.facebook.com/lucentfair/) (previously named Luna) is an annual creativity fair that aims to promote mental health awareness through art, workshops, talks, and performances. As the Creatives Head, I was responsible for designing of the event's identity and collateral + managing a team of ~5 creatives.

### Theme
A common thread I noticed in the stories of the mentally ill is that sadness is experienced as "a dark place". As a response to this, I decided to base the fair's theme on light. This can convey multiple positive meanings, like hope and warmth.  

### Color

The fair's palette consists of muted primary colors. Beige is the neutral used along with this.

### Logo

The fair's logo is an eye with a sun as its pupil. It represents both hope and awareness.
To give the fair's identity a "human" look, I decided to draw both the icon and logotype by hand. This was done through Procreate and Adobe Photoshop.

<p>
Hi! I'm Bianca Mikaila V. Aguilar -- a <span>digital artist and graphic designer</span> based in Manila, Philippines. I'm enthusiastic about how technology can affect humanity, specifically through fields like art, psychology, and philosophy. For this reason, I aspire to get into <span>UX + UI design</span> in the future. Basically, I'm a nerd.
</p>
<p>
My current vocation is developing visuals (e.g. illustration, media, branding) to empower <span>inclusive advocacies</span> like the following: feminism, mental health, and accessible technology. This is what I do as Chief Marketing Officer for <a href="https://developh.org">Developh</a> â€” a global non-profit investing in student-led innovation to break the technology gap. 
</p>
<p>
I graduated from the <span>Arts & Design strand</span> in De La Salle Santiago Zobel School. This coming fall, I'm excited to take up <span>AB Interdisciplinary Studies</span> (CS Programming & Information Design) at Ateneo de Manila University. 
</p>
<p>
In my free time, I'm a contemporary dancer, training in styles like ballet, jazz, modern, and lyrical. A dream of mine is to incorporate this passion with design and tech, one way or another.
</p>
<p><span>Some fun facts:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm an INFP-T.</li>
<li>Libra sun, Aries moon, Virgo rising.</li>
<li>I have an unhealthy? love of books, especially self-help.</li>
<li>I (terribly) play D&D...slowly but surely improving!</li>
</ul>

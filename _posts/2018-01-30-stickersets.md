## Sticker Set Designs
I created these two sticker sets as a way of finding my artistic style.

# Notes to Self
“Notes to Self” consists of self-care reminders shown in digital collage. It was created for Silakbo PH, a platform by the Filipino youth to uplift stories in the context of mental health awareness. 

# Art Hoe 101
“Art Hoe 101” consists of artistic puns displayed in digital painting. It is inspired by 5 famous painters: Leonardo da Vinci, Frida Kahlo, Vincent van Gogh, Salvador Dali, and Claude Monet.
